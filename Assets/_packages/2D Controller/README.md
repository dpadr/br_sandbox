# Ultimate 2D Controller - Extended

#### Verson 2 of the controller has been released!

Take note, version 2 is a game-breaking update. Basically everything has changed. <br>
The primary change is that it now uses velocity (replacing MovePosition) for easier interaction with the built-in physics system.

> **Warning**
> Completely remove the previous version before importing V2

##### I strongly suggest using the new input system

### You can view the script changes here and download the ready-made prefab from releases [here](https://github.com/Matthew-J-Spencer/Patreon/releases/tag/2D-Controller).
