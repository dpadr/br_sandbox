Hey there!

Thank you for buying Inked Adventure Items! It actually means a lot to me! I

problem, got a question or have some feedback, you can reach me easily via mail

variant is recommended for the default use of the icons.

	Modifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to modify the existing icons or create new icons in the same style,
there's a Tutorial.htm file in the topmost directory for you! It refers to the
Showcase.kra file, a Krita file. Krita is an amazing (and free!) digital
painting software available at krita.org.

Warning: if you make changes to the files, please copy the files to a different
location first, before you download a new version of the assets and hence
accidentally overwriting your modifications!
